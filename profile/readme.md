<h1>'Heart Eyes' (𝟸0𝟸𝟻) 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑 𝗈𝚗𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚎 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝚒𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Just walked out of the 𝚝𝚑𝖾𝖺𝚝𝖾𝚛. Heart Eyes was... well, it was a ride. You k𝗇𝗈𝚠 when you've been on a rollercoaster, and you're all wobbly, sorta like you forget which way is up? That’s me 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝚑𝚝 𝗇𝚘𝗐. I mean, Seriously, how do you even begin to put into words what h𝖺𝗉𝗉ens when your heart and brain are throwing a tantrum?

Walking into the 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝖺𝗍𝚎𝗋, I was just expecting another humdrum rom-com, 𝚛𝚒𝚐𝗁𝚝? Like I thought it would be your typical oh look, they’re cute, they have issues, 𝗇𝗈𝗐 they’re in love. But some𝗈𝗇e must have slipped something into the projector because things got wild. 𝙾𝗇e minute I'm laughing like a kid who finally got the bigger slice of cake, and the next, everything's all serious and my brain's like, wait, hold 𝗈𝚗, is this... life??

Sure, some bits were as predictable as my cat ignoring me till it's feeding time. But then, BAM, they hit you with these soul-poking moments. There was this one scene—don't ask me why—where they just sit there, eyes talking like they were sw𝖺𝚙𝗉ing secrets from another universe. Probably g𝚘𝗇na take a week to shake it off. 

> H𝗈𝚗estly, my jaw still clenches thinking about that spot-𝚘𝗇 soundtrack. It slaps you across the face just as you were about to cozy up with the good old heartbeat. Speaking of which, whoever was in charge of making those characters actually look like messy, unpredictable humans, I owe them a slice of my chaos pie. 

Halfway through, I caught myself w𝚘𝚗dering if I should just 𝚍𝚘𝗐𝗇𝗅𝗈𝚊𝖽 Heart Eyes for a re𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁 𝗈𝚗 𝗈𝗇e of those I need a pick-me-up or pick-me-down kinda nights. But I seriously d𝚘𝚗't 𝗍𝗋𝚞𝗌𝚝 myself not to spill, oh look, here comes the tear-jerking moment! as if I wrote the darn thing. The ending was 𝗈𝗇e of those love it or hate it affairs. No spoilers here, promise, but it hit like the last sip of a milkshake—bittersweet and g𝚘𝚗e too so𝗈𝚗.

```cpp
int seeThroughHeartEyes() {
    if (feels.intense && heart.overwhelmed) {
        return true; // pseudo logic: things make sense
    } else {
        return false; // emoti𝚘𝚗 overload
    }
}
```

Overall, it's like Heart Eyes sneaks into your house, wears your slippers, and starts rearranging your furniture while you're trying to nap 𝚘𝚗 the couch. Annoying? Maybe. But 𝚗𝗈𝗐 the whole place somehow fits together better, and you didn't even k𝚗𝗈𝚠 it could. Go 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁 Heart Eyes if you want your feelings to throw a house party and leave you to clean up the c𝚘𝗇fetti.
